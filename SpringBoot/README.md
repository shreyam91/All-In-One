# Spring Boot Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Spring Boot Projects** repository! This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, experiments, and learning exercises using **Spring Boot** and related Java technologies. You will find various Spring Boot applications, ranging from simple APIs to complex microservices and integrations with databases, messaging systems, and cloud platforms.

Feel free to explore, fork, and contribute to any of the projects. I continually update this repository with new Spring Boot-related projects and improvements.

## Technologies Used

This repository primarily focuses on **Spring Boot**, but many projects also integrate with other Java technologies and tools. Below is a list of the main technologies used:

- **Spring Boot** (for building Java-based applications)
- **Spring MVC** (Model-View-Controller framework)
- **Spring Data JPA** (for database integration)
- **Spring Security** (authentication and authorization)
- **Spring Cloud** (for microservices architecture)
- **Spring Batch** (for batch processing)
- **H2 Database**, **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB** (databases)
- **Docker** (containerization)
- **JUnit** / **Mockito** (testing frameworks)
- **Swagger** (API documentation)
- **Spring Boot Actuator** (for monitoring and metrics)

## Project Structure

Each project in this repository follows a general structure for Spring Boot applications. Here's the typical structure of a project:

```
/project_name/
    ├── src/                  # Source code
    │   ├── main/
    │   │   ├── java/         # Java source code
    │   │   │   └── com/      # Package structure
    │   │   │       └── example/       
    │   │   │           ├── controller/  # Controllers
    │   │   │           ├── service/     # Services
    │   │   │           ├── repository/  # Data access layer (JPA, MongoDB)
    │   │   │           ├── model/       # Domain models
    │   │   │           ├── config/      # Configuration classes
    │   │   │           └── Application.java # Main entry point
    │   └── resources/       # Configuration files (application.properties, etc.)
    ├── pom.xml              # Maven configuration (dependencies and plugins)
    ├── README.md            # Project-specific documentation
    └── Dockerfile           # Docker containerization (if applicable)
```

Each project has its own `README.md` with instructions on how to set it up and run it. Below is a general guide to get you started.

## How to Get Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run any Spring Boot project from this repository, make sure you have the following installed:

- **JDK 11 or later** (Spring Boot 2.x requires JDK 11+)
- **Maven** (for building the project) or **Gradle** (depending on the project setup)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerizing the application)
- **An IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java support)

### Cloning the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
cd spring-boot-projects
```

### Running the Projects

To run any of the Spring Boot projects, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd <project_name>
   ```

2. **Build the project** (Maven):

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   or for Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the project**:

   You can run the Spring Boot application using the following command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   or for Gradle:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

   Alternatively, if you prefer to run the JAR directly:

   ```bash
   java -jar target/<project_name>-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:

   The application will be running on `http://localhost:8080` by default. You can change the port in the `application.properties` file if needed.

### Running with Docker (Optional)

Some projects may include a `Dockerfile` for containerization. To build and run a project with Docker:

1. **Build the Docker image**:

   ```bash
   docker build -t <your_image_name> .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker container**:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:8080 <your_image_name>
   ```

3. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.

## Contributing

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new features to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature or fix'`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`).
6. Open a pull request.

Please make sure your code is well-documented, and if you're adding new functionality, include tests.
