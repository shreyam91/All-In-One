# Auto Complete Search Bar

## Description
The Auto Complete Search Bar is a solution to an interview problem where the goal is to implement an autocomplete feature for a search bar. As the user types in the search input, the search bar dynamically suggests possible matches based on a predefined list of words (usually from a dictionary or a set of recent search terms).

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of an autocomplete search bar that provides suggestions based on user input. The suggestions are filtered in real-time as the user types, improving the efficiency of the search process.

## Features
- **Real-time suggestions**: As the user types, the search bar suggests matching terms from a list of predefined words.
- **Efficient filtering**: The autocomplete function filters the suggestions based on the user's input, showing only relevant matches.
- **Case-insensitive**: The search bar ignores case differences while suggesting terms.
- **Basic search algorithm**: It implements a simple search algorithm to provide suggestions from a list or dictionary.

## Problem Statement
Given a list of valid search terms (e.g., a dictionary of words or recent search history), implement an autocomplete system that suggests matching terms based on partial user input. The suggestions should update as the user types, and the search should be efficient in terms of time complexity.


## Usage

1. Type in the search input box.
2. The search bar will provide a list of suggestions that match your input.
3. The suggestions are displayed below the input field.
