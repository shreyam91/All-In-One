React Machine Coding Interview Questions
This repository is designed to practice and solve React machine coding interview questions. It contains various coding challenges and exercises that you can implement using React to simulate real-world development scenarios. The purpose is to help you prepare for technical interviews, particularly focusing on front-end development with React.

Setup
Follow the steps below to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install Dependencies:
After cloning the repository, install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.

npm install
# OR
yarn install

3. Start the Development Server:
To run the development server and start coding, run the following command:

npm start
# OR
yarn start

This will start a local server at http://localhost:3000 where you can test and see the changes.

Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

│   └── index.html        # The HTML template for your app
│

│   ├── components/       # React components for solving individual problems

src/components/

Each interview question will have a corresponding component that solves the problem. You can create folders inside the components directory to group different challenges.

src/utils/
This folder contains utility functions or mock data that are used in different problems.

How to Use
1. Add Your Solution
Each challenge is implemented as a separate React component in the src/components/ folder.
To add a new solution, create a new file inside the src/components/ directory and implement the code.
Don't forget to import and use the component in App.js to test your solution.
2. Practice Problems
Each React problem is a real-world coding challenge commonly asked during front-end development interviews. Some example problems include:

Problem 1: Build a To-Do List with React (CRUD functionality).
Problem 2: Create a Paginated Table.
Problem 3: Build a Dynamic Form with Validation.
Problem 4: Build a Shopping Cart with Add/Remove functionality.
Problem 5: Create a Timer or Stopwatch app.
3. Testing the Solution
Use the npm start command to launch the local development server and see your solution live. As you implement each problem, test your solution by navigating through your app and interacting with it.

Questions
This repository will contain solutions to various machine coding questions asked in React/JavaScript technical interviews. Feel free to browse through and solve them to practice.

Here are some sample challenges you can implement:

1. Pagination...

Each of these challenges is designed to test your knowledge of React, state management, and component-based architecture.

Example of Usage
You can solve problems in isolation by focusing on one component at a time. For example, if you're solving the "Build a Timer" problem:

Create a new file in src/components/Timer.js.
Implement the Timer functionality using React state (useState) and effect (useEffect).
Test it by adding the component to App.js.
